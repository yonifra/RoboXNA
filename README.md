# Project Description
RoboXNA is a 3D real time robot simulation that let's you walk around a 3D scene with buildings, obstacles and environmental sounds.
This project is a final university project in Computer Graphics.

RoboXNA is a project that was created as a final computer graphics project for the bachelors degree in Computer Science.
The project is a 3D simulation of the Android robot, that moves around in space. The robot can move to all directions, and together with collision detection methods should stop if an obstacle has been reached.

All coding was made by the two developers in the "People" tab, so please - any comment will be appreciated!
